# Migrants or Refugees?
> _"Calling these people migrants makes their situation seem a lot less serious. 'Migrant' sounds like they're rushing to Europe to find better jobs, rather than fleeing an unspeakably brutal war. But the truth is that even the refugees just pretending to be Syrian are still fleeing from places like Iraq and Afghanistan that are also convulsed by endless waves of warfare."_
